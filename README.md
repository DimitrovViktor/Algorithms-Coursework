## Project Description

This project implements a London Underground route planning system using Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest travel time between any two stations on the Tube network.
Features

  - Models the entire London Underground system with all 11 lines

  - Calculates fastest routes between any two stations

  - Provides total journey time and step-by-step directions

  - Handles bidirectional travel with symmetrical journey times

## How to Use

  1. Run the Python script:

  2. python test2.py

  3. Enter your departure station when prompted

  4. Enter your arrival station when prompted

  5. The system will display the optimal route and total journey time

## Technical Details

  - Implements Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm

  - Graph data structure representing station connections

  - Travel times based on actual Tube journey durations

  - Error handling for invalid station inputs

## Requirements

   - Python 3.x

    No external dependencies required
